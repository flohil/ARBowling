To view the Unity Project and its source code, open the folder `ARBowling` in Unity.
To run the Android App, copy the file `arBowling.apk` to your Android phone.

Print out the files `ballTarget.jpg` and `pinsTarget.jpg` (or display them on a screen).

Install and run the `arBowling.apk` file on your Android phone.
Click on "New Game" and enter your player name.

Then point the camera of your Android phone at your ball target and pins target (make sure that both of them are
visible on your phone's screen).

The app should now display a bowling ball, a bowling alley and pins.
To throw the bowling ball, drag it towards the pins and drop it before the thin black line.

You can vary the distance between your ball and pins target as you wish (longer distances will give you 
a higher bonus points multiplier).
